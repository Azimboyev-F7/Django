																<p class="block-grid__item-description">We were excited to collaborate again with NIO for this year’s annual NIO Day, which oversaw their most ambitious launch yet of not one, but two brand-new smart flagship SUV models: the coupe EC7 and the all new ES8. Stemming from NIO’s latest second-generation platform, our team travelled to Cape Town and Miami to shoot location photography that captures the sense of vibrancy at the heart of both cities. Combining this photography with CG, we crafted a bespoke digital environment and carefully added the fully-CG cars: the outcome is a collection of visuals that combine both lifestyle and campaign imagery to reflect the perfect balance in each model.</p>
